            We Happy Few is an upcoming indie survival and exploration video game developed by
             Compulsion Games and published by Gearbox Publishing for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
             The game takes place in the mid 1960s in the fictional English city of Wellington Wells, a dystopian,
             retrofuturistic-fashioned drug-fuelled society formed following an alternative timeline of events within World
              War II, which is on the verge of collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
              The residents of the city, seeking to forget the war, began taking a hallucinogenic
              drug known as "Joy" which does that, but also leaves them constantly happy, easily controlled and
              lacking morals. Players control one of three characters, who becomes dubbed a "Downer" after choosing
              to stop using the drug, and must try to survive long enough to complete something important and personal
              to themselves, all while trying to escape the city before the impending social collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Played from a first-person perspective, the game combines role-playing, survival, and
              light roguelike elements, with the developers focusing on creating a story with strong narratives,
               gameplay underlined by a sense of paranoia, and decisions having moral gray areas and weight that
               influence and affect later parts of the game. Compulsion Games were influenced by similar media depicting
                dystopian societies, such as Brazil, Nineteen Eighty-Four, and Brave New World. Plans for the game's creation
               were announced through a Kickstarter funding campaign in June 2015, and was later announced to be supported
               by Microsoft Studios as part of their Xbox One platform. The game was released as early access
                title in July 2016, and will be fully released in mid-2018.

        The game takes place in October 1964 within an alternative timeline for Europe.
         In an alternative version of World War II, the Final Solution occurred several years before it
         did in real-world history, with catastrophic consequences for both Nazis and Jews, a revival of the
         second German Empire, and continued war across Europe, with that Empire successfully invading and occupying
         Great Britain and gaining control of the British Empire.[1][2] Britain surrendered and endured its occupation,
         which resulted in its contamination in a chemical-warfare experiment gone wrong, forcing the inhabitants of the
         fictional island city of Wellington Wells to do something terrible, subsequently filling the inhabitants with
         immense anguish and guilt over their actions.
       </p>
       <p>
         Seeking to forget what they did, the inhabitants invented a new hallucinogenic drug called Joy,
         which effectively caused all inhabitants to exhibit immense joy and happiness and suppressed all of
         their unhappy memories, but also caused them to be easily manipulated and decreased their ability to
         recognise moral and long-term consequences. Widespread use of the drug led to the city transforming into
         a dystopian society, with most of its inhabitants, referred to as "Wellies", wearing a white "Happy Face"
         mask as a sign of their continued jollity. Those who were naturally immune to Joy were forced out of the city
         and into its wastes, becoming "Wastrels" who subsequently went insane after wallowing in their own guilt and
         being unable to forget what happened.
       </p>
       <p>
         The transformation in the city's society led to efforts to ensure all its inhabitants regularly used Joy,
         including lacing most food and water with the drug, and 'Joy Booths', telephone box-like Booths' with
         Joy dispensers inside. Those who stopped taking it are dubbed "Downers" upon being discovered, pursued by
         locals and the city's police who try to reintegrate the Downer into society by either force-feeding them the
         drug or calling in a Joy Doctor to administer a liquid form of Joy, provided both parties do not beat the Downer
          to death and the Downer does not escape. Furthermore, the city's dystopia and isolation from the rest of the
          world after the end of the German occupation, led to Wellington Wells making resounding advances in technology,
          including Tesla-styled weapon systems, mobile power cells, and home security systems,
          all designed with 1960s aesthetics. While most buildings retain their "quaint English" exterior
           architecture and have 1960s interior styling and furniture, much of the exterior streets have notable
           differences as a result of the city's transformation.
