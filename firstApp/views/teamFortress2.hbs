            Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed
            and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to the 1996 mod Team Fortress for Quake
            and its 1999 remake, Team Fortress Classic. It was released as part of the video game bundle
            The Orange Box in October 2007 for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360. A PlayStation 3 version
            followed in December 2007. The game was released for Windows as a standalone entry in April 2008,
             and was updated to support OS X in June 2010 and Linux in February 2013. It is distributed online
             through Valve's digital retailer Steam, with retail distribution being handled by Electronic Arts.
           </p>
           <p>
             In Team Fortress 2, players join one of two teams comprising nine character classes,
              battling in a variety of game modes including capture the flag and king of the hill.
              The development is led by John Cook and Robin Walker, creators of the original Team Fortress.
               Announced in 1998, the game once had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay,
               but this changed over the protracted nine-year development. After Valve released no
               information for six years, Team Fortress 2 regularly featured in Wired News' annual
               vaporware list among other ignominies.The finished Team Fortress 2 has cartoon-like
               visuals influenced by the art of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell,
                and uses Valve's Source game engine.

      <p>
        Team Fortress 2 has similar gameplay as previous releases in the series due to its focus around
        two opposing teams competing for a combat-based objective. In the game's fiction, the teams are
        composed of mercenaries hired by two feuding brothers to protect the company assets belonging to
        one brother while trying to destroy those of the other; the teams are thus represented by the names
         of these companies: Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU).
       </p>
       <p>
         Players can choose to play as one of nine character classes in these teams, each with his own
         unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapons. In order to accomplish objectives efficiently, a balance
         of these classes is required due to how these strengths and weaknesses interact with each other in a
         team based environment. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier
         Team Fortress incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained, that being one primary weapon,
         one secondary weapon, and one melee weapon. The game was released with six official maps, although over
         100 maps have since been included in subsequent updates, including competitive remakes of older maps and
         community-assembled maps.When players join a level for the first time, an introductory video
         shows how to complete its objectives. During matches, the "Administrator", a woman voiced by
         Ellen McLain, announces various game events over loudspeakers.The player limit is 16 on the Xbox
         360 and PlayStation 3.On the PC, in 2008 Valve updated the game to include a server variable that
         allows up to 32 players.
       </p>
       <p>
         Team Fortress 2 is the first of Valve's multiplayer games to provide detailed statistics for individual players.
          They include: time spent playing as each class, most points obtained, and the most captures or objectives
          achieved in a single life. Persistent statistics tell the player how he or she is improving in relation
          to these statistics, such as if a player comes close to his or her record for the damage inflicted in a
          round.Team Fortress 2 also features numerous "achievements" for carrying out certain tasks,
          such as scoring a certain number of kills or completing a round within a certain time.
          New sets of class-specific achievements have been added in updates, which add new
           abilities and weapons to each class once unlocked by the player. This unlockable
            system has since been expanded into a random-chance system, where the player can
            also obtain the items simply by playing the game.
