            PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a multiplayer online battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of publisher Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games using the 2000 film Battle Royale for inspiration, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release on December 20, 2017. That same month, the game was released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program. The game was localized and released by Tencent Games in China, while two mobile versions based on the game for Android and iOS were also released in early 2018. By March 2018, the Windows version had sold over thirty million copies and held a peak concurrent player count of over three million, an all-time high on Steam, while the Xbox One version sold over five million itself.

      <p>
        Battlegrounds is a player versus player (PvP) action game in which up to one hundred
         players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch
         where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo,
          or with a small team of up to four people. In either case, the last person or team left
          alive wins the match.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto a map area approximately
          8 by 8 kilometres (5.0 mi × 5.0 mi) in size.The plane's flight path across the map varies
          with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute
           to the ground.Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do
            not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings and other sites to
            find weapons, vehicles, armor, clothing, and other equipment. These items are procedurally
             distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones
              typically having better equipment.Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear
              as well.Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective,
               each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness;
                though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective
                to eliminate some advantages.
              </p>
              <p>

                Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random
                 location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally,
                 and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the
                 players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.
                 This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.
                  During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red
                  and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.In both cases,
                   players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to
                   relocate to safety.At random, a plane will fly over various parts of the
                    playable map and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically
                    unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke,
                     drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations.On average,
                      a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.

Although it's one of the more accessible games of this type, there's a lot to learn and nothing to show you the ropes if you're on your own.
