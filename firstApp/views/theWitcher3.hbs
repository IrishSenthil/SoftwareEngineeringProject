            The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing video game developed and
            published by CD Projekt. Based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej
             Sapkowski, it is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. Played in an open
             world with a third-person perspective, players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter
             known as a Witcher, who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt:
             an otherworldly force determined to capture and use her powers. Players battle the game's many dangers
             with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete main-story and side quests to
             acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment.
             Its central story has several endings, determined by the player's choices at certain points in the game.
           </p>
           <p>
  Development began in 2011 and lasted for three-and-a-half years, of which over two-and-a-half
  years were devoted to voice recording. The writing was infused with real-life aspects like moral ambiguity
  in a deliberate attempt to avoid simplification, impart authenticity, and reflect Sapkowski's novels.
  Europe was the basis of the game's open world, with Poland, Amsterdam, and Scandinavia as its primary inspirations.
   REDengine 3 enabled the developer to create a complex story without compromising the game world, whose size was
   enlarged by PlayStation 4 and Xbox One technology. The music was primarily composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz and performed
   in Germany by the Brandenburg State Orchestra.

        The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective.
         Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher. Geralt walks, runs, rolls
          and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons,
           including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).The steel sword is used primarily to
           kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters. Players can draw out,
           switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak,
            and heavy attacks are slow and strong. Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords.Swords
            have limited endurance and require regular repair.
          </p>
          <p>
             In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical
            signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen.Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast,
            Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective
            shield. The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely.Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's
            magic power. They lose health when they are attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health
             loss. Health can be restored with meditation or consumables, such as food and potions.Players control Ciri,
             Geralt's adoptive daughter who can teleport short distances, in certain parts of the game.It has responsive,
              advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and dynamic environments. The day-night cycle influences some monsters
              (and their powers), as a werewolf becomes powerful during the night of a full moon.Players can learn about
              their enemies and prepare for combat by reading the in-game bestiary.
            </p>
            <p>
              When they kill an enemy, they can
              loot its corpse for valuables.Geralt's witcher sense enables players to find objects of interest,
              including items that can be collected or scavenged. Items are stored in the inventory, which can be expanded
              by purchasing upgrades.Players can sell items to vendors or use them to craft potions and bombs.
              They can visit blacksmiths to craft new weapons and armour with what they have gathered.
               The price of an item and the cost of crafting it vary, depending on a region's local economy.

                    The Witcher has always done a great job of making me feel that I’ve outsmarted my foes,
                    but for the first time here, controlling Geralt feels tangibly badass with every successful fight.

                      Roasting a crowd of witch hunters is not only satisfying on its own terms,
                      but has a sweet justice to it: the first steps you make in the city of Novigrad
                       lead you to a witch-burning in progress.
